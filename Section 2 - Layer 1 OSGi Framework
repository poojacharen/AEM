1. OSGi Framework - Open Service Gateway Initiative (to manage the lifecycle of its various components and services)
      - It is instrumental in managing the life cycle of diverse components and services within the AEM architecture
      - It servers as a specification for a java-based dynamic module system, enabling the modularization of software for enhanced manageability and update capabilities at 
        the individual component level (for java that allows java app to be broken into bundles)
      - Within AEM, OSGi governs the management pf various bundles or modular components constituting the system
      - Each bundle is a self-contained unit of functionality that can be installed, started, stopped or uninstalled independently of the other bundles 
      - This modular approach renders AEM highly adaptable and scalable facilitating seamless addition or removal of functionalities as required
      - Moreover, the OSGi framework fosters a dynamic env. by facilitating the hot deployment of new bundles, obviating the need for system wide restarts
      - This feature streamlines the process of introducing new features or addressing bugs while maintaining uninterrupted system operation
      
Apache Felix - AEM Employs Apache Felix as its OSGi framework implementation
             - Renowned for its widespread usage and extensive configurability
             - Apache Felix arguments the OSGi framework with additional features, including a web console for bundle management and a shell for system interaction
The OSGi framework constitutes a pivotal component of the AEM architecture providing the foundational framework for its modular and extensible design
This framework significantly simplifies the management and updating processes of the AEM's diverse components
