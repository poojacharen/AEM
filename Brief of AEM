Why Do We Use AEM?
AEM is used because it helps businesses:
✔ Easily Manage Content – You can create, edit, and publish content (text, images, videos) without coding.
✔ Re-use Content – Create content once and use it across multiple pages or channels (website, mobile app, social media).
✔ Personalization – Show different content to different users based on their preferences or behavior.
✔ Scalability – AEM supports large websites with thousands of pages and global audiences.
✔ Integration – Works well with other Adobe tools like Photoshop, Analytics, and Target for marketing and design.

Example:
A company like Nike might use AEM to manage their website. If they launch a new shoe, they can:
👟 Add product images and descriptions easily.
🌍 Publish the same content in multiple languages for different countries.
🎯 Personalize content (e.g., show running shoes to a runner and basketball shoes to a player).

AEM makes website management faster, easier, and more efficient for businesses! 🚀
