What makes AEM as a cloud service diff from other versions of AEM ?
1. Author and Publisher instances can be scaled up and down based on the actual traffic site is incurring without any downtime
2. Any code and configuration chang now can be pushed by checking into GIT repos only via the Cloud Manager
3. AEM Cloud Service is licensed based on the number of page views for Publish tier
4. In AEM as a Cloud Service /apps and /libs are immutable whereas /conf,/content,/var are mutable

Explanation of the above points
- Basically in an AEM application, eployment must be comprised of a single AEM package. This package should in turn contain sub packages that comprise everything required by the application
to function including coe, configuration or any supporting baseline content.
- On the other hand AEM is a cloud service requires a separation of content and code, which means a single content package cannot deploy to both /apps or runtime wrietable areas like content, 
conform etc...
- Apps are considered immutable areas of failure as they cannot be changed after AEM is started. Any attempt to change an immutable area at runtime will fail
- Everything else in the repo like /content, /conf, /var folder, home, etc, oak indexes etc... are mutable areas , meaning they can be changed at runtime
