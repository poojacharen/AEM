2. Java Content Repository (JCR) - The content repo is a core component of the AEM architecture
                                 - The content repo is a hierarchical, tree like structure where each node in the tree represents a piece of content such a page or an image
                                 - It's responsible for storing, managing and retrieving all of the content for the website such as pages, images and documents
AEM uses the Apache Jackrabbit Content Repo, which is a java-based content repo that conforms to the JCR specification
Jackrabbit provides a number of features that make it well suited for use in AEM such as support for versioning, access control and full tech search.
                                - The content repo is also accessible via the sling web framework which allows developers to interact with content repo using a RESTful API
                                - This makes it easy to integrate AEM with other systems and to create custom apps that interact with the content repo
AEM also includes an optional component called CRX (Content Repo Extreme) which provides a more robust and scalable content repo tha the default Apache Jackrabbit repo
It provides more efficient data storage and retrieval with the help of advanced data modeling and indexing techniques
Overall, the content repo is a key component of AEM and plays a critical role in managing and delivering content to website users
