AEM is a cloud service aims to standardize deployment architectures for all customers, releinving them of many operational concerns.

At high level AEM consists of 3 primary classsifications:
1. Content Management - which handles content creation, authoring and management
-- Authors - can utilize various methods such as drag and drop interfaces, form based authoring or even document based authoring through tools like Microsoft SharePoint or Google Docs
-- AEMs content management offers authors flexibility with various content creation and management options.
-- The author tire operates as a zero downtime cluster and automatically scales based on authoring activity via Adobe Managed Orchestration Services 
-- Additionally, digital asset management and business process execution are supported, ensuring brand and organizational alignment
-- Content uthors ccess AEM authoring using Adobe's Identity Management Service, which is managed through Adobe's Admin Console
-- Aems authoring service can read and write content from content repo, while Adobe manages a range of maintenance job to ensure optimal performance
-- The replication service is responsible for publishing or unpublishing content from the AEM author tier or editors to AEMs experienced delivery services

2. Experience Delivery is responsible for delivering high impact experiences to end users, be it websites, headless experiences or any other media including images or video
-- AEM experience delivery consists of 2 main concerns : 
1. Edge Delivery Services
2. Container Orchestration Service

We might be wondering how the authoring can be done using a tool such as Microsoft SharePoint or Google Docs ?

The edge delivery service also known as Next Gen Composability or previously known as Adobe Franklin offers an intuitive method for website creation
It seamlessly integrates with authoring tools like Microsoft SharePoint or Google Docs

AEM Publish and Preview Tiers are another way to deliver experiences with AEM
- The Publish Tier enables live production experiences, while 
- The Preview Tier enbles authors to preview content changes before making them live
- The AEM Publish Tier consists of a pair of AEM publishers and AEM dispatchers. with the number of pairs scaling automatically based on load and all manged by Adobe's Orchestration service

Adobe's Managed CDN enhances experience delivery or if desired a custom managed CDN can be used 

- Last , is a set of ancillary services that facilitate the management and deployment of custom code to AEM, as well as collab channel that allows customers to interact with Adobe and use
intelligent bots to help gain insights into AEM as well as with performing certain tasks
- Git safely stores custom code with distributed version control enabling collaborative development while maintaining data integrity
- The CI/CD service allows developers and administrators to manage testing and deployment of custom code
- The CI/CD service reads code from the git service, validates code quality using testing service and finally deloys code to the appropriate areas of AEM content mngmt and experienced delivery
