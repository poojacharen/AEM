First, the content authors create and update content on the website within the authoring environment. Once the content undergoes review and
approval, it is then published or replicated to the published servers. Additionally, te website employs web servers or te dispatcher module.
Here's how the process unfolds. When a user accesses a page on your website, the request is initially routed to the load balancer. The load-
balancer subsequently directs this request to one of the webservers depending on it's capacity. The dispatcher then verifies whether the 
requested page is actually cached and servers the content if it's available. This caching mechanism ensures that the published servers do not 
need to render content each time, thereby enhancing the website's performance. If the dispatcherdoes not have the requested content cast, it
will retrieve the content fron the publish servers and serve it to the end user
