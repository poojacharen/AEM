ðŸ”¹ Example: Suppose you run an e-commerce website (e.g., Adidas). With Adobe Marketing Cloud, you can track customer behavior, personalize content, and optimize marketing campaigns
            to increase sales.
ðŸ”¹ Why: AEM is part of Adobe Experience Cloud, which includes 8 tools like Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, and Adobe Campaign. These help businesses analyze user behavior and 
        improve website performance to generate revenue.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Imagine you own a news website. You frequently update headlines, articles, and images. Instead of coding everything manually, AEMâ€™s Content Authoring allows 
            non-technical users to update content easily using a GUI (drag-and-drop).
ðŸ”¹ Why: With AEM, you donâ€™t need a developer to make simple changesâ€”content authors can do it themselves, making websites more dynamic and easier to maintain.

- It provides flexible and friendly enviroment to the content authors.

            them from scratch.
ðŸ”¹ Why: This saves development time and effort because AEM already includes essential components, templates, and workflows that can be customized as needed.

ðŸ”¹ Example: A marketing team at Coca-Cola wants to manage website promotions. Since AEM has a simple GUI with drag-and-drop features, their team can quickly learn how to 
            update content, reducing dependency on IT teams.
ðŸ”¹ Why: AEM is easier to use compared to traditional CMS platforms, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users.
