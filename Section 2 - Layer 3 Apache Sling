3. Apache Sling - It's a open-source web framework utilizes within the AEM architecture, manages the processing of requests and responses within the system
                - It operates on top of the OSGi framework and assumes responsibility for mapping webste URL's to corresponding content within the content repo
                - Employing a REST like API, sling facilitates request handling and resource mapping to the content repo
                - It adopts a resource oriented approach, wherein each resource corresponds to a node within teh content repo, with the properties of these nodes exposed as request parameters 
                - This setup enables developers to readily access and modify repo content through a straightforward and consistent API
                - Furthermore, sling offers a robust scripting engine supporting various languages such as JavaScript, Ruby and Groovy
                - Developers leverage this functioanlity to script request processing and response generation, thus simplifying the creation of custom components and apps interfacing with
                  content repo

Summary:
Sling serves as a critical component within the AEM acrhitecture providing a fundamental framework for request handling and content repo interaction
It's capabiities empower developers to effortlessly craft custom components and applications capable of accessing and manipulating repo content
